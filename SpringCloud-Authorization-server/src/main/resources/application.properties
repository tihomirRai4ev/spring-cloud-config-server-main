#TODO Tihomir check and verify this - So far my understanding regarding the scopes is this:
#Scopes are the actual permissions. Here we provide several scopes which will be available for the generated OAuth token from this service 
#provider. However if the resource for which we are authenticating requires another/diff scope the request to this resource will fail.
